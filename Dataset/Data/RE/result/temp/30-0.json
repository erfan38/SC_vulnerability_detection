        "vulnerabilityReason": "The interfaces and libraries provided in the code snippet do not contain any implementation that could be vulnerable to reentrancy. However, further assessment is required when contracts/interfaces invoke external calls, especially via the call.value function.",
        "potentialSecurityRisk": "While the provided interfaces themselves are not vulnerable, any contracts implementing these interfaces should be scrutinized for reentrancy vulnerabilities when transferring funds or interacting with external contracts.",
        "fixedCode": "The code provided doesn't present any reentrancy vulnerability directly in its interfaces or libraries. Implementing contracts should ensure all interactions with external contracts are reentrancy-safe. For example: function withdraw(uint _amount) public { require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount); balances[msg.sender] -= _amount; msg.sender.transfer(_amount); }"
