# GPT-J 6B: Efficient Avoidance of Vulnerabilities in Auto-completed Smart Contract Code Using Vulnerability-constrained Decoding
How to efficiently fine-tune the transformer model to avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-complete code? To eliminate vulnerabilities in the generated code, they propose the vulnerabilityconstrained decoding method, which fine-tunes the transformer using labeled vulnerable code and then restricts the model from generating vulnerable code by using labels as guidance during the decoding.
