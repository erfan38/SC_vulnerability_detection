After analyzing the existing dataset in the field of smart contract vulnerability, we decided to use the most comprehensive and reliable dataset gathered from "Empirical Review of Automated Analysis Tools on 47,587 Ethereum Smart Contracts" and the Dataset from Messi-Q GitHub.

Data from result.json that has LoC
Data from preprocessing_data from Messi-Q GitHub (data with label) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UhHHevE9iDmvSB_k_lhyI58KAj7hnB1o/view


# Based on "Empirical Review of Automated Analysis Tools on 47,587 Ethereum Smart Contracts"

Using SmartBugs to run 9 tools on 2 datasets. Only two vul. Were detected by four or more tools. Dataset: Smartbugs

delegatecall: unchecked_low_level_calls
IOU: arithmetic
time dependency: time manipulation
reentrancy: reentrancy

===================================================================
In results, results_wild we can see 47,451 smart contracts used by tools. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-results/master/metadata/results_wild.json

We have all the tools' results in the above file.

If we want to have a specific tool result:
results/slither/icse20
https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-results/tree/master/results/slither/icse20
 You can choose one specific tool like Slither, and go through icse20 and find the address of the contract like: 0x0000000000027f6d87be8ade118d9ee56767d993 as I found it from https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild/blob/master/contracts/

# GPT-J 6B: Efficient Avoidance of Vulnerabilities in Auto-completed Smart Contract Code Using Vulnerability-constrained Decoding
How to efficiently fine-tune the transformer model to avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-complete code? To eliminate vulnerabilities in the generated code, they propose the vulnerabilityconstrained decoding method, which fine-tunes the transformer using labeled vulnerable code and then restricts the model from generating vulnerable code by using labels as guidance during the decoding.
