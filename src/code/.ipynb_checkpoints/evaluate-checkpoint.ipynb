To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Same as `text`.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation.

The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having\n            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed\n            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and\n            layout.\n        legendwidth\n            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for\n            this trace.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Line` instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        lowerfence\n            Sets the lower fence values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute\n            has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If\n            `lowerfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or\n            `x`) is set, we compute the lower as the last sample\n            point below 1.5 times the IQR.\n        lowerfencesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `lowerfence`.\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Marker` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        mean\n            Sets the mean values. There should be as many items as\n            the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect\n            only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If `mean` is not\n            provided but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we\n            compute the mean for each box using the sample values.\n        meansrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `mean`.\n        median\n            Sets the median values.

To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the\n            legend item and on hover. For box traces, the name will\n            also be used for the position coordinate, if `x` and\n            `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and the\n            position axis is categorical\n        notched\n            Determines whether or not notches are drawn. Notches\n            displays a confidence interval around the median. We\n            compute the confidence interval as median +/- 1.57 *\n            IQR / sqrt(N), where IQR is the interquartile range and\n            N is the sample size. If two boxes' notches do not\n            overlap there is 95% confidence their medians differ.\n            See https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home\n            /notched-box-plots for more info. Defaults to False\n            unless `notchwidth` or `notchspan` is set.\n        notchspan\n            Sets the notch span from the boxes' `median` values.\n            There should be as many items as the number of boxes\n            desired. This attribute has effect only under the\n            q1/median/q3 signature. If `notchspan` is not provided\n            but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we compute it as\n            1.57 * IQR / sqrt(N), where N is the sample size.\n        notchspansrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `notchspan`.\n        notchwidth\n            Sets the width of the notches relative to the box'\n            width. For example, with 0, the notches are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the box(es). If \"v\" (\"h\"), the\n            distribution is visualized along the vertical\n            (horizontal).\n        pointpos\n            Sets the position of the sample points in relation to\n            the box(es). If 0, the sample points are places over\n            the center of the box(es). Positive (negative) values\n            correspond to positions to the right (left) for\n            vertical boxes and above (below) for horizontal boxes\n        q1\n            Sets the Quartile 1 values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired.\n        q1src\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `q1`.\n        q3\n            Sets the Quartile 3 values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired.\n        q3src\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `q3`.\n        quartilemethod\n            Sets the method used to compute the sample's Q1 and Q3\n            quartiles. The \"linear\" method uses the 25th percentile\n            for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using\n            method #10 (listed on\n            http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The\n            \"exclusive\" method uses the median to divide the\n            ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd,\n            it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is\n            then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of\n            the upper half. The \"inclusive\" method also uses the\n            median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves\n            but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in\n            both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half\n            and Q3 the median of the upper half.\n        sd\n            Sets the standard deviation values. There should be as\n            many items as the number of boxes desired. This\n            attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3\n            signature. If `sd` is not provided but a sample (in `y`\n            or `x`) is set, we compute the standard deviation for\n            each box using the sample values.\n        sdmultiple\n            Scales the box size when sizemode=sd Allowing boxes to\n            be drawn across any stddev range For example 1-stddev,\n            3-stddev, 5-stddev\n        sdsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `sd`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Selected` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showwhiskers\n            Determines whether or not whiskers are visible.\n            Defaults to true for `sizemode` \"quartiles\", false for\n            \"sd\".\n        sizemode\n            Sets the upper and lower bound for the boxes quartiles\n            means box is drawn between Q1 and Q3 SD means the box\n            is drawn between Mean +- Standard Deviation Argument\n            sdmultiple (default 1) to scale the box size So it\n            could be drawn 1-stddev, 3-stddev etc\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each sample\n            value. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a \"text\" flag.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        upperfence\n            Sets the upper fence values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute\n            has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If\n            `upperfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or\n            `x`) is set, we compute the upper as the last sample\n            point above 1.5 times the IQR.\n        upperfencesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `upperfence`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        whiskerwidth\n            Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box'\n            width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        width\n            Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0\n            (default value) the width is automatically selected\n            based on the positions of other box traces in the same\n            subplot.\n        x\n            Sets the x sample data or coordinates.

See overview for more info.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.

We\n            compute the confidence interval as median +/- 1.57 *\n            IQR / sqrt(N), where IQR is the interquartile range and\n            N is the sample size. If two boxes' notches do not\n            overlap there is 95% confidence their medians differ.\n            See https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home\n            /notched-box-plots for more info. Defaults to False\n            unless `notchwidth` or `notchspan` is set.\n        notchspan\n            Sets the notch span from the boxes' `median` values.\n            There should be as many items as the number of boxes\n            desired. This attribute has effect only under the\n            q1/median/q3 signature. If `notchspan` is not provided\n            but a sample (in `y` or `x`) is set, we compute it as\n            1.57 * IQR / sqrt(N), where N is the sample size.\n        notchspansrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `notchspan`.\n        notchwidth\n            Sets the width of the notches relative to the box'\n            width. For example, with 0, the notches are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the box(es). If \"v\" (\"h\"), the\n            distribution is visualized along the vertical\n            (horizontal).\n        pointpos\n            Sets the position of the sample points in relation to\n            the box(es). If 0, the sample points are places over\n            the center of the box(es). Positive (negative) values\n            correspond to positions to the right (left) for\n            vertical boxes and above (below) for horizontal boxes\n        q1\n            Sets the Quartile 1 values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired.\n        q1src\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `q1`.\n        q3\n            Sets the Quartile 3 values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired.\n        q3src\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `q3`.\n        quartilemethod\n            Sets the method used to compute the sample's Q1 and Q3\n            quartiles. The \"linear\" method uses the 25th percentile\n            for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using\n            method #10 (listed on\n            http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The\n            \"exclusive\" method uses the median to divide the\n            ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd,\n            it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is\n            then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of\n            the upper half. The \"inclusive\" method also uses the\n            median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves\n            but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in\n            both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half\n            and Q3 the median of the upper half.\n        sd\n            Sets the standard deviation values. There should be as\n            many items as the number of boxes desired. This\n            attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3\n            signature. If `sd` is not provided but a sample (in `y`\n            or `x`) is set, we compute the standard deviation for\n            each box using the sample values.\n        sdmultiple\n            Scales the box size when sizemode=sd Allowing boxes to\n            be drawn across any stddev range For example 1-stddev,\n            3-stddev, 5-stddev\n        sdsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `sd`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Selected` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        showwhiskers\n            Determines whether or not whiskers are visible.\n            Defaults to true for `sizemode` \"quartiles\", false for\n            \"sd\".\n        sizemode\n            Sets the upper and lower bound for the boxes quartiles\n            means box is drawn between Q1 and Q3 SD means the box\n            is drawn between Mean +- Standard Deviation Argument\n            sdmultiple (default 1) to scale the box size So it\n            could be drawn 1-stddev, 3-stddev etc\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets the text elements associated with each sample\n            value. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a \"text\" flag.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.box.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        upperfence\n            Sets the upper fence values. There should be as many\n            items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute\n            has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If\n            `upperfence` is not provided but a sample (in `y` or\n            `x`) is set, we compute the upper as the last sample\n            point above 1.5 times the IQR.\n        upperfencesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `upperfence`.\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        whiskerwidth\n            Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box'\n            width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as\n            the box(es).\n        width\n            Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0\n            (default value) the width is automatically selected\n            based on the positions of other box traces in the same\n            subplot.\n        x\n            Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for\n            more info.\n        x0\n            Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the\n            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using\n            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the x\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        xperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        xperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            alignment of data points on the x axis.\n        xsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `x`.\n        y\n            Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for\n            more info.\n        y0\n            Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the\n            starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using\n            q1/median/q3. See overview for more info.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If \"y2\", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        ycalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.\n        yhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.
