      "Integer overflows and underflows are not a new class of vulnerability, but they are especially dangerous in smart contracts, where unsigned integers are prevalent and most developers are used to simple int types (which are often just signed integers). If overflows occur, many benign-seeming codepaths become vectors for theft or denial of service.\n",

      "## Attack Scenario\n",
      "A smart contract's withdraw() function allows you to retrieve ether donated to the contract as long as your balance remains positive after the operation.\n",

      "function withdraw(uint _amount) {\n",

      "The fourth example features the soon-to-be-deprecated var keyword. Because var will change itself to the smallest type needed to contain the assigned value, it will become an uint8 to hold the value 0. If the loop is meant to iterate more than 255 times, it will never reach that number and will stop when the execution runs out of gas:\n",
